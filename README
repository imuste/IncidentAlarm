Incident Alarm is a Python-based tool that scans pcap files for signs of 
suspicious or malicious network activity. It identifies various network 
incidents and reports them to help users analyze network traffic efficiently.

The purpose of this assignment is to provide the user with a way to scan pcap
files and detect concering communication in this pcap file. The program detects 
the following incidents:
 - NULL scan
 - FIN scan
 - Xmas scan
 - Plain text username and passwords (HTTP / FTP / IMAP)
 - Nikto scan
 - SMB scan
 - RDP scan
 - VNC scan
Any signs of this type of communication in the pcap will be reported when
running the program with that pcap file. 

This project utilizes Scapy, a powerful Python library for packet manipulation 
and analysis, to parse and inspect pcap files.

This project taught me to use scapy to detect incidents in pcap files by 
learning about these types of incidents in depth and how they can be 
detected. For example what ports they are on, what transport layer protocols
they use, etc. 


/*****************************************************************************
 RUNNING THE PROGRAM
*****************************************************************************/
- Create a new environment with 'python3 -m venv env'
- Activate the environment with 'source env/bin/activate'
- Install scapy
- Run the program with 'python3 alarm.py -r [pcapFile]'

In this directory, three pcap files are present that can be used to run the
program. So an example command is 'python3 alarm.py -r set3.pcap'

Once the program is running, the detected incidents will be reported by way
of printing these to the terminal. If the user wants, they can redirect this
output to a file to get a clear overview of the incidents in this file.

Some example incident alerts when running the program look like:
ALERT #1: NULL scan is detected from 192.168.0.5 (TCP)!
ALERT #2: Usernames and passwords sent in-the-clear (HTTP) (username:admin, 
        password:12345)

This program was implemented and written by me apart from a bit of starter
code to read in the pcap file written by Ming Chow at Tufts University.
